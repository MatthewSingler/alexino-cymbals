Alexino Cymbals is a basic e-commerce application built for Alexino Cech, an Austrian Cymbal maker. This project was built for my first client side capstone during my time at Nashville Software School. The tech stack used includes React, JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS and JSON. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/2ae2a900d2f041da66e950e4d48052658d850630/icons/react/react-original.svg" alt="react logo" width="50" height="50" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/2ae2a900d2f041da66e950e4d48052658d850630/icons/javascript/javascript-plain.svg" alt="javascript logo" width="50" height="50" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/2ae2a900d2f041da66e950e4d48052658d850630/icons/html5/html5-plain.svg" alt="html5 logo" width="50" height="50" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/2ae2a900d2f041da66e950e4d48052658d850630/icons/css3/css3-plain.svg" alt="css logo" width="50" height="50" />

Features are not yet complete and this is only a working prototype. I hope to deploy the application for Alexino and incorporate payment options.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
